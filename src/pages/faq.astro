			<p>What are you trying to substitute?</p>
			<p><b>Spices:</b> Maybe, depends on your taste and whether you think it would go along with the other things in the ingredients list.</p>
			<p><b>Meats, vegetables, fruits, carbs:</b> You probably could, but make sure to change the cooking time to ensure the substitute is properly cooked.</p>
			<p><b>Dough Ingredient:</b> Google would be a much better source, but I am trying to compile a good list of substitutes that have worked for me in the past.</p>

			<p>Short answer: no.</p>
			<p>Long answer: if you're baking something (bread, cakes, etc.), then the ratio of flour, leveners (yeast, baking soda, etc.), and sugar, and the ratio of wet to dry ingredients are a little more peculiar. The margin of error is a little smaller than anything else. That isn't to say that you must be exact, but it is to say to not eyeball things.</p>
			<p>I also believe it is better to undersalt a dish than oversalt. You can adjust the flavour easier that way.</p>
			<p>Otherwise, you're probably fine. I encourage tweaking recipes to experiment with what suit your tastes. Everyone's taste buds are different.</p>

			<p>Having at least one meal per day for the past {Intl.NumberFormat("en-CA").format(Math.floor(new Date().getTime() / msPerDay - new Date(2000, 2, 26).getTime() / msPerDay))} days refined my palate and gives me all the credibility I need to deliver this site's contents.</p>
			<p>I also have friends who <i>usually</i> say my food tasted good.</p>
