Dice <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">onion</span> into small cubes.

Mince the <span class="ingredient" data-id="8">garlic</span>.

Mix **all the ingredients** in a bowl until well combined.

Divide and shape into patties of your desired thickness and size. Use a spoon to gently indent the centre so that it doesn't puff up.

Heat a pan/skillet/bbq and cook until well done all the way through. This is about 3-4 minutes per side for a thick patty and 2 minutes per side for a thin patty.
> If you trust the butchery you sourced the meat from, it can be less than well done, but well done is the safest way to cook any burger regardless of where you bought it.

Eat however you wish!
