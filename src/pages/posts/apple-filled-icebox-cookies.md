# Making the dough
Cream <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">butter</span> and then add <span class=ingredient data-id="2">powdered sugar</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="3">salt</span>. Whip the mixture until light and fluffy for a crispy cookie.

Add <span class="ingredient" data-id="5">vanilla</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">egg</span> and mix.

Sift the **dry ingredients** (<span class="ingredient" data-id="6">flour</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="7">cornstarch</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="8">baking powder</span>) in. Mix thoroughly.

# Decorating the dough
[Examples of how to decorate at the end of the section.](#examples)
## Planning
Figure out what image to make the cookies in beforehand. I've done birds, bears, and apples.

Draw out the design you want to do, the simpler the easier. Separate the parts of the design by colour, and determine the shapes each colour should have. If the shape if complex, try breaking it down.

## Colouring

Add a little bit of food colouring to the dough and gently knead until well incorporated. 

Add a little bit more and repeat until the right colour is achieved.

## Shaping and cutting
Fundamentally, the cookie dough will be shaped into a log, chilled to solidify, and cut into cookies. 

Create each individual shape and refrigerate wrapped in parchment paper for one hour to maintain its shape when combining.

Combine the shapes together and refrigerate again for another hour to maintain its shape when baking.

With a sharp knife/dough scraper, cut the log into ~0.5 cm slices.

Decorate the slices with other coloured doughs/extra ingredients if necessary.

Freeze until ready to put into the oven.

## Examples
> The following are some examples of approximate breakdowns of colour and shapes for some sample end-products.

[Skip to baking](#baking)

### Apples
- **White flesh**: 80% of all dough, initially rolled into a circular log and then have the top and bottom indented with chopsticks (for uniformity)
- **Red skin**: 10% of all dough, flattened out into a rectangle and rolled around the flesh portion
- **Brown stem**: 5% of all dough, made into a triangle-shaped log and placed in the top indent point-down
- **Green leaf**: 5% of all dough, made into a teardrop-shaped log and placed on the side of the stem

After slicing the cookies, cut a chocolate chip in half and add to the center to make seeds.

### Bears
- **Dark brown head**: 95% of all dough. Of this dough, use about 90% to make one large circular log (face) and then remaining 10% to make two smaller circular logs (ears)
- **Light brown/pale snout**: 5% of all dough. To be used later after the cookies are sliced.

After slicing the cookies, on every other cookie, take a pinch of dough, roll it into a ball, and then flatten to make a snout. You could also use it to make the inner ears.

On the same cookies, add two black sesame seeds for eyes and one for the nose.

### Rooster
- **Plain body**: 93% of all dough. Take the majority of the plain dough to form a log that is mostly round but wider on the bottom. Take the rest of the plain dough to make two teardrop-shaped logs for the wings.
- **Red comb**: 3% of all dough. Make a small oval-shaped log and place on top of the body long-side-down.
- **Red wattle**: 2% of all dough, to shape after the cookies are cut.
- **Yellow beak**: 2% of all dough, to shape after the cookies are cut.

After slicing the cookies, on every other cookie, add black sesame seeds for eyes. 

Take a pinch of the yellow beak dough and make a triangle for the beak. 

Take a pinch of the red dough and make a teardrop for the wattle, placing it below the beak.

# Baking
Bake at 320°F/160°C for 15 min. Let cool completely before creating the sandwiches.

# Making the jam
Dice the <span class="ingredient" data-id="9">apples</span> and put in a pot with the <span class="ingredient" data-id="10">sugar</span>. Boil on medium heat. When the water is almost all evaporated, add <span class="ingredient" data-id="11">lemon juice</span>. Turn off the heat and keep it on the stove until the mixture is thickened. 

# Sandwiching the cookie
Once the cookies have been cooled, pair up cookies that have similar shapes (the cookies will likely not be uniform). Some cookies might have a darker side, which you may or may not want to hide.

Take a spoonful of the jam and place it on one cookie, and sandwich the other cookie on top.
