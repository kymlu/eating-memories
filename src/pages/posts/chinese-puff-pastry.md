### CREATE WATER DOUGH
1. Add **sugar** in room temperature softened **butter**, mix well.
2. Mix in **flour**. Once relatively mixed together, use fingers to rub until the texture is soft and sandy.
3. Add **warm water**. Mix until it can come out of the bowl cleanly. 
4. Wrap up with cling wrap and rest for 30 mins.

### CREATE OIL DOUGH
1. Soften **butter** to room temperature.
2. Add the **flour** and **cornstarch**. Mix into a dough.

### MIX WATER AND OIL DOUGHS
1. Knead the water dough.
> There are many ways to combine the doughs together. You could combine them in portioned sections, or combine it all at once. Additionally, you could **[fold it into thirds](#folding)**, or **[roll them](#rolling)**. I don't see anything wrong with mixing and matching.

> If portioning:
>> 1. Divide the water dough into 47g portions.
>> 2. Divide the oil dough into 36g portions.
>> 3. Complete the below for each individual portion.

1. Roll out the water dough (doesn't need to be too thin).
2. Shape the oil dough to fit slightly smaller than half of the rolled out water dough. Put on one side of the rolled out water dough.
3. Fold the uncovered water dough overtop the oil dough. Seal the edges tightly, avoiding bubbles.
4. Rest for 15 minutes.

#### FOLDING
1. Roll out the dough into a rectangular(ish) shape.
> Don't worry if it rips a little. No one will notice (probably).
2. Fold the left and right on top of each other, overlapping the middle section to create 3 layers.
3. Wait 20 min. 
4. *Optional* Repeat step 1-3 two more times, but in step 3, fold the top and bottom over each other the second time, and then left and right again the third.

#### ROLLING
1. Roll out the dough into a rectangular(ish) shape.
> Don't worry if it rips a little. No one will notice (probably).
2. From the bottom, tightly roll up the dough.
3. Wait 20 min. 
4. *Optional* Repeat step 1-3 two more times, rotating the dough 90 degrees each time.

### FILL AND COOK
1. Roll out the dough.
> If you didn't portion the dough beforehand, now is the time to portion them out.
>
> Alternatively you can put the filling on half of the dough and put the other half of the dough on top like ravioli.
2. Add the filling you want. Don't overfill.
> **THIS IS HARD THE FIRST TIME AROUND.** Experiment with a volume that works for you.
3. Bake for the appropriate time at the appropriate temperature.
