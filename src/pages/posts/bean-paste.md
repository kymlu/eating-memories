# COOK BEANS
> Optionally, soak beans overnight (8-12 hrs) if you want to cook faster or remove the skin beforehand.

Put **beans** into a pot and pour cold water over it to just cover the beans.

On medium heat, bring beans to a boil. Boil for ~2 minutes while foam appears.

Drain the beans. Rinse the pot and put the beans back in. Pour enough cold water to cover the beans.

Cover the pot but leave the lid slightly ajar. Simmer on low heat until beans become tender (~1.5 â€“ 2 hours). Check on beans occasionally for:
- **Foam?** Skim it
- **Insufficient water?** Add more to cover beans

When you can ~~destroy~~ crush beans between two fingers, it is done.

Drain the beans, but keep the bean water for the next steps.

# MASH BEANS
To mash the beans, blend it using a food processor. Add some bean liquid if it is thick.
> It shouldn't be watery, but maybe a little thicker than apple sauce (can't think of other things to compare it to).
>
> Optionally press the beans through a sieve using a spatula to ensure extra-smoothness. 
>
> If you don't have a blender, use the sieve method or use a mashing tool of your choice.

# THICKEN BEANS
Put paste in a clean saucepan. Add **oil**, **sugar** and **salt**, and mix.
> When adding sugar and salt, it's better to undersalt if you're concerned about flavour. You can add more if it's not to your taste.

On medium-low heat, let the sugar dissolve. 
> The paste will become liquidy! This is normal.

Continue to heat the mixture to evaporate the liquid, mixing occasionally with a spatula until it becomes a smooth paste that maintains its structural integrity (15-20 min).
> **To test!** Become one with Moses and use your spatula to part the ~~seas~~ beans. If the beans don't try to return to its original form, you're gucci.

Transfer the paste into a container if not using immediately.
> To store:
> - Refrigeration: good for a few days
> - Freezing: good for a couple of months
