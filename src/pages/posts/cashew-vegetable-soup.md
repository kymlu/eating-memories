Add ingredients to a 4L pot and fill the pot up with cold water.

Put pot on a stove on high.

Once the water boils, turn the stove down to low and simmer for 1.5 hours.

Add a sprinkle of salt, stir, and taste. Repeat until the flavour is right.
> Even after adding salt, the flavour will generally be sweet!
