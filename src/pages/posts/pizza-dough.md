In a bowl, combine <span class="ingredient" data-id="1" data-proportion="0.5">flour</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">yeast</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="3">sugar</span>, and <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">salt</span>. Add the <span class="ingredient" data-id="5">seasoning</span> if you want.

Add the <span class="ingredient" data-id="6">olive oil</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="7">water</span> to the dry ingredients and combine.

Gradually knead in the remaining <span class="ingredient" data-id="1" data-proportion="0.5">flour</span> while mixing. Add more if necessary. The dough should pull off the sides of the bowl and tacky (but not sticky) to touch.

Grease a separate bowl with some <span class="ingredient" data-id="9">olive oil</span>.

Form the dough into a ball and dust with some <span class="ingredient" data-id="8">flour</span>. Put into the greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. 

Set aside in an ideally warm place for 30 minutes or until the dough has doubled in size.
> Warmer temperatures help activate the yeast faster.

With your fist, punch down on the dough to deflate it. Knead the dough a few times on a lightly-floured surface. 

Line a pizza pan with parchment paper. Stretch the dough out and place onto the pizza pan.
> Parchment paper is optional but it will help get the pizza off of the pan more easily.
> 
> Alternatively, you can dust the pan with flour or oil, though the effects on the dough will be different.

Using a fork, poke a bunch of holes in the dough.
> This prevents the dough from rising too much in the oven.

Add whatever sauces and toppings to the pizza.

Bake at 425°F/215°C for 13-15 minutes.
