# Prepare the meat
Cut the <b class="ingredient">pork</b> into bit-sized chunks against the grain.
> The **grain** is the direction in which muscle fibers run. You can tell by setting your meat down flatly and seeing where the line go. 
>
> To **cut against the grain** means to cut perpendicular to the grain.

Mix together the <b class="ingredient">soy sauce</b>, <b class="ingredient">oyster sauce</b>, and <b class="ingredient">minced garlic</b>. Add the pork chunks and massage the seasoning in with the pork.

In a separate bowl, mix together the <b class="ingredient">cold water</b> and <b class="ingredient">cornstarch</b> to make a slurry. Add it to the pork and massage together.

Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a lid and refrigerate for over an hour.

# Cook the meat
Add some <b class="ingredient">oil</b> to a frying pan and set the heat to high.

When the oil is heated, add some <b class="brown sugar"></b> and mix the sugar and the oil.

When the mixture starts bubbling, add the <b class="ingredient">garlic cloves</b> and let cook, mixing occasionally. 

When the colour of the garlic starts changing, add the pork and seasoning mixture.

In a separate bowl mix equal parts **water** and **cornstarch** to make a slurry, starting at around 1 tbsp.

When the pork is cooked to about 60%, add the slurry to the pan, and finish cooking the pork. You do not need to cover the pan.

Taste the pork and sauce and adjust the flavour and sauce thickness as needed.

Serve with rice!
