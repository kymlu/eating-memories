Blend the <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">chestnuts</span> in a blender/food processor.

Incrementally add a little bit of <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">water</span> and mix with the ground chestnut until it forms a puree.

Move the chestnuts to the saucepan and add <span class="ingredient" data-id="5">butter</span>. 

Heat on low to melt the butter and mix it in with the chestnuts.

Add the <span class="ingredient" data-id="3">sugar</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">salt</span> and mix together. The mixture will become very liquidy, but after heating (stirring ocassionally) for 20-25 minutes, it will thicken up into a paste. 
> **To test!** Become one with Moses and use your spatula to part the ~~seas~~ chestnuts. If the chestnuts don't try to return to its original form, you're gucci.
