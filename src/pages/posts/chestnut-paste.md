Blend the **chestnuts** in a blender/food processor.

Incrementally add a little bit of **water** and mix with the chestnut puree until the mix is a little wet, like thick apple sauce.

Move the chestnuts to the saucepan and add **butter**. Heat on low to melt the butter and mix it in with the chestnuts.

Add the **sugar** and **salt** and mix together. The mixture will become very liquidy, but after heating (stirring ocassionally) for 20-25 minutes, it will thicken up into a paste. 
> **To test!** Become one with Moses and use your spatula to part the ~~seas~~ chestnuts. If the beans don't try to return to its original form, you're gucci.
