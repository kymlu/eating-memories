# CREATE WATER DOUGH
1. Add <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">sugar</span> to room temperature softened <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">butter</span>, mix well.
2. Mix in <span class="ingredient" data-id="3">flour</span>. Once relatively mixed together, use fingers to rub until the texture is soft and sandy.
3. Add <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">warm water</span>. Mix until it is cohesive and can come out of the bowl cleanly. 
4. Wrap up with cling wrap and rest for 30 mins.

# CREATE OIL DOUGH
1. Soften <span class="ingredient" data-id="5">butter</span> to room temperature.
2. Add the <span class="ingredient" data-id="6">flour</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="7">cornstarch</span>. Mix into a dough.
3. Divide the oil dough into as many parts as you have colours. Colour each part with the <span class="ingredient">food colouring</span>. If the dough becomes sticky, add a little extra flour.
> **CAUTION**: when adding gel food colouring, make sure to add a little at a time until you get the target colour because food colouring is very powerful.

> Ideas for colour palettes: 
> - Single colour gradient
>   - Separate into 3 parts. Ensure the first part has the least food colouring, and add more for each additional part.
> - Rainbow
>   - Make each part a different colour.

# MIX WATER AND OIL DOUGHS
1. Knead the water dough briefly and then divide it into 47g portions.
2. Weigh each colour of the oil dough and divide evenly among the target number of mooncakes/2. The sum of each colour together should be around 36g.

For each individual portion:

1. Roll out the water dough into a short rectangle (doesn't need to be too thin).
2. Shape the coloured oil dough into little logs and place them vertically in order on the water dough to fit half of the rectangle.
3. Fold the uncovered water dough overtop the oil dough. Seal the edges tightly, avoiding bubbles.
4. Cover with cling wrap and rest for 15 minutes.
5. Roll out the dough with a rolling pin vertically to 25-30 cm long. Roll the dough up with your hands from left-right so that you can still see the gradient top to bottom.
6. Roll out the dough with a rolling pin vertically to 60-70 cm long. Starting from the side with the colour you would like to see at the top, roll the dough up tightly with your hands. 
7. Cover with cling wrap and rest for 15 minutes. If the ambient temperature is warm, put it in the fridge in that time.

# SHAPING
1. With a sharp blade, cut the roll in half in a downward motion (do not go back and forth).
2. Place the dough cut-side down. Flatten and roll out the dough into a circle. The edges with naturally curve up.
3. Fill the dough with a spoonful of filling and seal the opening.

# BAKING
1. Preheat the oven to 300°F/150°C.
2. Line a sheet with parchment paper and arrange the pastries onto the sheet seal-side down.
3. Bake for 20-25 minutes.
