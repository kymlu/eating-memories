# SKIN
Mix the **dry ingredients**.

Add the **wet ingredients** and mix until the milk and oil don't separate.

Steam for 20-25 min.
> When it is done, the oil should separate from the rest of the dough. If you poke it with a spatula, the dough shouldn't be liquid.

Wait for it to get warm. Knead into a ball.

Wrap and cool for at least 30 minutes.
> It is better to assemble and mold it right before consumption. The skin will keep for a few days in the fridge or a few months in the freezer.

# ASSEMBLY
Divide the skin into ~25g pieces.

For each piece:
1. Roll into a ball and flatten.
2. Take 25g of filling and roll into a ball.
3. Wrap the filling into the skin, sealing all the edges, shaping into a ball.
> It might be easier to mold if you make it a little taller and skinnier. The mold will flatten it.
4. Dust the mold and ball with cooked glutinous rice flour. Put the mold onto the ball and squish it down slowly and firmly.

Consume immediately.
> Will keep ok in an airtight container in the fridge for a couple of days, though the skin will eventually dry up. Take it out of the fridge ~30 minutes before eating to bring up to room temperature.
