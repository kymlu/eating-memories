> **WHAT VEGGIES SHOULD I USE?**
>
> Any veggie will work. Experiment. Doesn't have to be tomato.
>
> I like having additional 3-4 kinds of veggies for a variety of flavour and nutrients.
>
> The onion and garlic are for the flavour.

Preheat oven to 400F/205C.

Chop veggies into large pieces. 
> Generally around the size of half a fist but everyone's fists are different. 
>
> For reference, I cut onions and large tomatoes into quarters, roma tomatoes into halves.
> Garlic cloves should be separated but whole.

Put all the veggies into a bowl and dizzle oil onto it. Mix to coat all the veggies.
> Oil prevents burning.

Distribute the veggies onto the sheet pan evenly. Shake seasonings onto the veggies as you see fit.

Bake for 30-35 minutes if the veggies are generally small and thin, or 45-50 minutes if they are round and chunky.

Transfer the veggies into a pot and use an immersion blender or a masher, or use a blender/food processor to break the veggies down to a desired chunkiness/smoothness. Add pasta water if it is too thick.
> Adding pasta water to the sauce will also help the sauce adhere to the pasta more!
