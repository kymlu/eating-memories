Mix the **wet ingredients** together.

Add the **dry ingredients** and combine.

Put the mixture onto a double boiler and mix in the **butter** until melted.
> To make a double boiler:
> 
> Add some water (not too much) to the pot and heat on high. Put the metal bowl on top of the pot.

Strain through a sieve into a saucepan and heat on medium, constantly stirring and folding until it becomes a thick paste. Can turn off the heat towards the end.

Let cool before using.
