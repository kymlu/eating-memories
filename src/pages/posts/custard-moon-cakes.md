Mix the **wet ingredients** together.

Add the **dry ingredients** and combine.

Put the mixture onto a double boiler. Add <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">butter</span> and mix until melted.
> To make a double boiler:
> 
> Add some water (don't need too much) to the pot and heat on high. Put the metal bowl containing the mixture on top of the pot.

Strain mixture through a sieve into a saucepan and heat on medium, constantly stirring and folding until it becomes a thick paste. Can turn off the heat towards the end.

Let cool before using.
