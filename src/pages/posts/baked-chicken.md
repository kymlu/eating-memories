Preheat the oven to 450째F/233째C. 

Cut up the <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">onion</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="3">potatoes</span>, and <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">carrots</span> into large chunks.
> Other vegetables like cauliflower and broccoli are also good!

Put the <span class="ingredient">vegetables</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">chicken</span> in a bowl. Add enough <span class="ingredient" data-id="5">oil</span> to lightly coat all the ingredients. Season with <span class="ingredient" data-id="6">pepper</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="7">salt</span>, and <span class="ingredient" data-id="8">other seasonings</span> as you wish. Toss the items in the bowl together to coat everything evenly.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and place all the ingredients on the sheet. Prepare a sheet of aluminum foil to place on top later (not yet).

Put the baking sheet in the oven and bake for 15 minutes.

Take the sheet out of the oven and set the oven temperature to 375째F/190째C. Put the aluminum foil on top and bake for an additional 30 minutes. For the last 5 minutes, take the foil off.
> Don't need to wait for the oven temperature to go down before putting it back in.
> 
> Can cook for ~5 minutes longer to get crispier skin, but be careful to not dry the chicken out.
