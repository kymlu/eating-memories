In a bowl, mix <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">flour</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">salt</span>, and <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">sugar</span> together.

Create a well in the center of the ingredients and add <span class="ingredient" data-id="5">water</span>. Sprinkle <span class="ingredient" data-id="3">yeast</span> into the center. Wait 1 minute for the yeast to bloom slightly and hydrate.
> Yeast blooming looks like the liquids being a bit bubbly.

Add <span class="ingredient" data-id="6">oil</span> to the bowl. With a rubber spatula, mix the dough until cohesive.
> It will be very sticky! Don't worry about it.

Drizzle some <span class="ingredient" data-id="7">oil</span> over the surface of the ball of dough and spread the oil around the surface until it is all covered.
> It's ok to go a little overboard with the oil. The purpose is to prevent a crust from forming around the ball when it is rising.

Seal the dough in an airtight container, or cover with a towel/cling wrap. Let bulk ferment for 8-24 hrs in the fridge. The dough should double in size.
> The longer it rests, the more flavour develops (I think). Technically, you could do it for up to 72 in the fridge. However, longer fermentation will make the flavour more sour.
> 
> If choosing to let the dough ferment in room temperature, only ferment for up to 18 hours (even less in warmer environments).
> 
> If you're short on time, I would recommend leaving in room temperature for an hour. If it's cold outside, let a microwave/oven heat for a minute, turn it off, and put the dough inside.

At the end of the bulk fermentation, drizzle the bottom of a 9x5 pan with <span class="ingredient" data-id="7">oil</span>. 

Take the dough from the fridge and deflate it by bringing the edges to the center. Put the dough onto the pan and stretch it to fit the shape of the pan. It is okay if there is resistance.

Drizzle some more oil on top of the dough. Let the dough rise uncovered in room temperature for 1-4 hours. The dough will be ready if you poke it with your finger and it returns slowly, leaving an indent.

Preheat the oven to 425F/220C. 

Poke many holes all over the dough with your fingers. Make the holes deep enough to reach the bottom of the pan.

Sprinkle the dough with <span class="ingredient" data-id="8">salt</span> and/or other toppings as you wish.
> Examples of other toppings:
> - Thinly sliced vegetables (the less juicy the better)
> - Cherry tomato halves
> - Italian seasoning (oregano, basil, rosemary, thyme)
> - Pesto
> - Cheese
> - Caramelized onions
>
> Google will have a lot of good ideas!

Bake for 20-30 minutes until golden brown.

Let cool for 15-20 minutes before eating.
