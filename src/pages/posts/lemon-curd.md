Whisk the <b class="ingredient">egg</b> in a metal bowl.

Add some water to a pot to create a double boiler and put on a stove on high to heat the water.

Put the <b class="ingredient">sugar</b>, <b class="ingredient">lemon juice</b>, optionally the <b class="ingredient">lemon zest</b>, and <b class="ingredient">salt</b> into the metal bowl and heat over the double boiler, whisking until the mixture is thick like hollandaise sauce (~10 min).

Take the double boiler off stove and whisk in the <b class="ingredient">butter</b> until melted.

Cover with plastic wrap to avoid a film from being created. Refrigerate until use.
