Whisk the <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">egg</span> in a metal bowl.

Add some water to a pot to create a double boiler and put on a stove on high to heat the water.

Put the <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">sugar</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="3">lemon juice</span>, optionally the <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">lemon zest</span>, and <span class="ingredient" data-id="5">salt</span> into the metal bowl and heat over the double boiler, whisking until the mixture is thick like hollandaise sauce (~10 min).

Take the double boiler off stove and whisk in the <span class="ingredient" data-id="6">butter</span> until melted.

Cover with plastic wrap to avoid a film from being created. Refrigerate until use.
