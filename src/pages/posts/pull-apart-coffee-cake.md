> While this recipe is for a chocolate-cinnamon dessert, you can change up the recipe for other flavour profiles! Examples:
> - Cheese and herb
>   - Add some 1 tbsp rosemary and 1 tbsp parsley to the dough.
>   - Ignore the instructions for the topping.
>   - Create a herb butter by mixing the softened butter with 
>     - 1 tbsp rosemary
>     - 1 tbsp parsley
>     - 2 minced garlic cloves
>     - a pinch of salt.
>   - When shaping the dough, flatten each piece of dough, spread the butter and the sprinkle some shredded cheese on top. Fold each piece in half to prevent cheese from falling out before placing in the pan.
> - Cheese and pesto
>   - Same as the cheese and herb recipe, but add some finely chopped basil to the dough and use pesto instead of herb butter

Heat up the <span class="ingredient" data-id="6">milk</span> in a saucepan until lukewarm. Turn off the heat, add <span class="ingredient" data-id="7">instant yeast</span>, and let sit for 8 minutes.

In a stand mixer, beat <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">butter</span> until fluffy. 

Add <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">eggs</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="3">egg yolks</span> and whisk on low speed until mixed but lumpy.

Beat in <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">sugar</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="5">salt</span> until well combined.

Add the milk and yeast mixture, and then add <span class="ingredient" data-id="8">flour</span>. Mix briefly.

Switch to a dough hook and and knead on low speed until the mixture comes together to form a soft but not sticky dough (2-3 minutes). If the dough is sticky, add a little more flour.

Remove the dough and oil the bowl with <span class="ingredient" data-id="9">vegetable oil</span>. Shape the dough into a ball and put it in the bowl. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 1-2 hours, until doubled in size.

In the meantime, make the filling. Mix <span class="ingredient" data-id="10">melted butter</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="11">brown sugar</span>, and <span class="ingredient" data-id="12">cinnamon</span> together. The chocolate chips come later.
> It will harden if let to cool, so to let it be easier to work with, make this right before working with the dough.

Prepare the topping by rubbing <span class="ingredient" data-id="14">brown sugar</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="15">flour</span>, and <span class="ingredient" data-id="16">softened butter</span>.

Grease a bundt pan with <span class="ingredient" data-id="17">butter</span>. Sprinkle the bottom with the topping.
> No bundt pan? No problem! Use two 9" x 5" pans and bake for the same amount of time. Or make half the recipe in 1 pan.

When the dough has risen, preheat the oven to 350F/175Â°C.

Punch down the dough to deflate the air. Divide into 24 pieces. Roll each piece to flatten into a square. Spread some filling and sprinkle some chocolate chips on one side. Place each piece into the bundt pan vertically and in front of one another so that it runs around the pan in a ring.
> Alternative shaping method: divide the dough into small golf ball-sized pieces and roll each piece into a ball. Distribute half of the balls along the bottom of the pan. Put half of the filling on top and sprinkle the chocolate chips on. Repeat for the remaining balls and fillings.

Bake for 40 minutes.

Cool for a little. When the pan can be handled, flip the pan over a plate to remove the bread. Let cool more before eating.
