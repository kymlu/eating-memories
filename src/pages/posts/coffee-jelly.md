Add <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">water</span> into a bowl or measuring cup. Add the <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">gelatine</span> and mix together briefly.

Add <span class="ingredient" data-id="3">instant coffee</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">boiling water</span>, and <span class="ingredient" data-id="5">sugar</span> to the water/gelatine mixture. Stir for a few minutes until the gelatine is completely dissolved and you can't see the grains.
> You can make non-instant coffee, just make sure the amount of water adds up. It's better to have a lighter coffee flavour.
> 
> Experiment! Next time try substituting some of the coffee with cocoa powder.

Separate the mixture evenly into bowls or cups. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours.

In a bowl, mix the <span class="ingredient" data-id="6">cream</span> with <span class="ingredient" data-id="7">sugar</span>. Refrigerate until the jelly is ready. Pour on top of the jelly before serving.
> Some people would sift some cocoa powder on top! Also, instead of liquid cream, you can try using whipped cream, condensed milk, or evaporated milk instead.
