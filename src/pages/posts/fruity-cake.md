Preheat oven to 350F/175C.

In a bowl, whisk the **wet** ingredients together.

Sift the **dry** ingredients into the wet. Mix until the batter is just combined.

If you rinsed the fruit, dry them with a paper towel.

In a separate bowl, add the **flour** and the **fruit**. Toss together until all the fruit is covered.

Add the flour-covered fruit to the batter and mix briefly.

Lightly **butter/oil** up the inner walls of a 9x5 pan and lightly sprinkle **flour** to cover. Alternatively, line the pan with parchment paper.

Pour the batter into the pan.

> For some extra tang to elevate the cake, you can add lemon curd.
> 
> 1. Make a batch of [lemon curd]("../../lemon-curd) or buy some.
> 2. Layer the batter and lemon curd in the following order. Make sure the previous layer is flat by gently tapping the pan onto the counter a few times:
>>  - 1/3 of the batter
>>  - Lemon curd 
>>  - 1/3 of the batter
>>  - Lemon curd 
>>  - 1/3 of the batter

If decorating with fruit, coat them with a bit of flour and add them on top.

Bake for 1 hour. I like leaving it in the oven after turning the heat off for ~10-15 more to bake a bit more in the residual heat.

Let cool before eating.
