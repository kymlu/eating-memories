Mix **everything** together.

Can refrigerate or use immediately.
> Might be good to make a large batch to use over time. If doing so, save in an airtight container.

# To use
Marinate the meats/veggies for 5-10 minutes.

Heat up a pan (no oil needed). **Keeping the sauce on the side,** add the food to the pan and cook to 80% doneness.

Add the sauce to the pan and finish cooking the food.
