Preheat oven to 350°F/175°C.

Sift all the **dry ingredients** into a bowl and whisk together until combined.

In a separate bowl, cream the <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">butter</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">sugar</span> together until light in colour and fluffy. 

Add the remainder of the **wet ingredients** and mix together until well incorporated.

Add the dry ingredients mixture into the wet ingredient and mix until just combined.

In a small bowl, mix the **topping** ingredients together.

Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.

Scoop up a spoonful of the cookie dough and roll into a ball. Roll the ball into the topping. Arrange the balls onto the cookie sheet.

Bake for 13 minutes.
