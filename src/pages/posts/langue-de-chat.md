> The most important part is that the weights of the butter, sugar, and flour are abut equal to the weight of the egg. An extra large egg is about 50g.

Preheat the oven to 390°F/200°C.
> For less colour, bake at 350F/175°C.

Cream <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">butter</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">sugar</span> together.

Mix in <span class="ingredient" data-id="3">egg</span> and the <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">vanilla extract</span> until combined.

Mix in <span class="ingredient" data-id="5">flour</span> until combined.

Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

Put the batter in a piping bag or ziplock bag (and cut a hole in one of the corners). Pipe 10 cm long strips (or other shapes if you want).

Bake for 12 minutes, rotating the sheet halfway through.

Let cool completely before eating to maintain shape.
