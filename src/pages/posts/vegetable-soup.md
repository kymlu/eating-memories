Soak cashews, peanuts, and beans in cold water for a few hours before cooking.

Dice the vegetables into small pieces.
> Can add other vegetables or remove some depending your preferences and stock at home.

In a pot, add <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">cold water</span> and bring to a boil.

Add **all the non-water ingredients**.

Turn the stove down to low and simmer for at least 1 hour, 2 hours for softer veggies. Skim the froth from the top of the soup if necessary.

Add a sprinkle of salt, stir, and taste. Repeat until the flavour is right.
> Even after adding salt, the flavour will generally be sweet!
