Wash and dry the **walnuts**. Bake at 375F/190C for 8-10 minutes.

Add the walnuts, the **rice flour**, and **half of the water** to a blender/food processor and blend until well combined.

In a pot, add the walnut mixture, the **remaining water**, and **sugar**. Heat on low for 10 minutes. If the mixture is too thick for you, add more water.

Add the **evaporated milk** and cook for another minute.

Serve immediately.
