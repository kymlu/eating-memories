Preheat oven to 350°F/175°C.

Cream the <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">butter</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">sugar</span> together by hand or with a hand mixer/stand mixer.

Add in <span class="ingredient" data-id="3">egg</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">vanilla extract</span> and combine.

In a separate bowl, combine <span class="ingredient" data-id="5">flour</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="6">cocoa powder</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="7">baking soda</span>, and <span class="ingredient" data-id="8">salt</span>.

Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix until just combined.

Line the cookie sheet with the parchment paper.

Scoop a tablespoon of dough at a time onto the cookie sheet.

Bake for around 9 minutes. If adding <span class="ingredient" data-id="9">salt</span> on top, immediately sprinkle it on top after taking out the cookies. 

Let the cookies cool a little to solidify a bit before transferring to a rack to cool completely.
