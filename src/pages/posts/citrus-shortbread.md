Preheat oven to 320°F/160°C.

Cream the <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">butter</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">powdered sugar</span> together by hand or with a hand mixer/stand mixer.

Add <span class="ingredient" data-id="3">salt</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">orange zest</span> and combine briefly. If using <span class="ingredient">food colouring</span>, add that now.

Add the <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">flour</span> and combine. May need to add extra flour if the food colouring made it too wet. 
> You can alternatively add food colouring at this step, but gently knead it and be careful to not overwork the dough.

Line the cookie sheet with the parchment paper.

Roll out the dough to around 1/4 inch or 0.6 cm thickness. Cut out the cookies with the cookie cutters and arrange them onto the parchment paper.
> In the past, I've separated the dough into different colours and used various cookie cutters to layer them in an appealing way. You don't have to do this. And you don't have to use tiny cookie cutters either.

Bake for 12 minutes until slightly browned.
