In a mug, add <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">flour</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">sugar</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="3">cocoa powder</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">salt</span>, and <span class="ingredient" data-id="5">baking powder</span>. Mix with a chopstick until combined.
> The cake doesn't have to be chocolate! You can replace the cocoa powder with extra flour, and then add whatever flavouring you want instead. Some ideas:
- 1/8 tsp cinnamon powder
- 1 tsp citrus juice + zest

Add in <span class="ingredient" data-id="6">milk</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="7">melted butter</span>, and <span class="ingredient" data-id="8">vanilla extract</span>. Mix until just combined.

If adding toppings, mix them in briefly.

Microwave the mug for 90 seconds. It is done if the top is a little shiny but not runny. If it's not fully cooked, microwave again for 15 seconds at a time until it is.

Let cook for 1 minute before eating.
