Melt the <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">butter</span> in the <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">milk</span> over low heat.

Mix **all the ingredients** together.

Knead on a floured surface for 2 minutes. If the dough sticks to your hands, add a little more flour.

Rest for 30 minutes.
> This will let the gluten in the dough relax. Once relaxed, you can shape the dough how you want more easily.
> 
> Not letting it rest will make the dough bounce back if you try to shape it.

Divide the dough into 6 sections. Flatten them into 8"/20cm rounds.

Heat a pan on high. Do not add oil.

Place the round in the pan. Heat for 1 - 1.5 minutes, until it puffs up.

Flip the round over and heat for another 0.75 - 1 minute, until it puffs up.

> Variation on the recipe I have made include (for 6 servings) 
> - 18g minced garlic and 25g minced green onions
> - 75g pesto instead of the 50g butter
