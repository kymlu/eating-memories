Heat some **oil** in a pan and add the diced **onion**. Heat until translucent. 

Add the **charsiu**, **soy sauce**, **sugar**, and **black pepper** and stir fry a bit. 

Mix together the **cold water** and **cornstarch**. Let reduce until it become a little thick and saucy. If there isn't enough sauce to your liking, you can add more water. 

Take off the heat and let cool.

Preheat the oven to 400F/205C.

Portion the puff pastry into the number of servings you are making. Add a spoonful of the filling onto the middle. Fold the pastry and seal (or shape however you want).

Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Line the pastries onto the pan.

Whisk the **egg** to create the egg wash. Brush on the egg wash.
> For a some extra flair, add sesame seeds on top!

Bake for 30 mins. Let cool for 10 minutes before eating.
