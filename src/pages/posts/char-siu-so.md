Heat some <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">oil</span> in a pan and add the diced <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">onion</span>. Heat until translucent. 

Add the <span class="ingredient" data-id="3">charsiu</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">soy sauce</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="5">sugar</span>, and <span class="ingredient" data-id="6">black pepper</span> and stir fry a bit. 

Mix together the <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">cold water</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="8">cornstarch</span>. Let reduce until it become a little thick and saucy. If there isn't enough sauce to your liking, you can add more water. 

Take off the heat and let cool.

Preheat the oven to 400°F/205°C.

Portion the <span class=ingredient data-id="10">puff pastry</span> into the number of servings you are making. Add a spoonful of the filling onto the middle. Fold the pastry and seal (or shape however you want).

Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Line the pastries onto the pan.

Whisk the <span class="ingredient" data-id="9">egg</span> to create the egg wash. Brush on the egg wash.
> For a some extra flair, add sesame seeds on top!

Bake for 30 mins. Let cool for 10 minutes before eating.
