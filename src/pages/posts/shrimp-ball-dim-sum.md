Peel and devein <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">shrimp</span>. You can mince until it becomes a paste for a finer texture, or can dice into small pieces if you want it chunky.
> If mincing, you can use a food processor.

Dice <span class="ingredient" data-id="10">water chestnut</span>. 
> The original dish called for lotus root, but I tried it once and didn't like the texture.
>
> If you do use lotus root, note that if you leave it out for too long, the colour may darken significantly. Place cut lotus root in some water with a splash of vinegar and leave it there until you're ready to use it.

Mince <span class="ingredient" data-id="11">garlic cloves</span>.
> I tried using green onions once, it didn't taste as good.

Combine the all the **filling** and **seasoning** ingredients into a bowl. Mix in one direction until a sticky paste forms.
> Can chill the mixture for 20 minutes to firm up the paste and make it easier to work with.

For each of the <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">spring roll wrappers</span>, roll into a cylinder and slice into fine strips. Unravel and lay the strips flat out on a sheet or a plate.
> Somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 cm, but can slice even finer for a crispier texture that's easier on the mouth.

Wet your hands with water and then roll a tablespoon of shrimp into a ball, about 1 - 1.5 inches wide. Roll the ball onto the strips until coated.
> It's ok if you can see some shrimp.

In a pan/wok, heat oil to 350°F/175°C and then fry in small batches until golden brown, around 4-5 minutes each. After frying, place the balls onto a paper towel to drain the oil. Place drained balls on a wire rack or a plate.
> To deep fry, heat oil on high until it hits the desired temperature. Put the balls in and take out when it's ready. Wait until the heat hits the desired temperature again before adding a new batch.

Is good plain, but can also taste good with a sweet and sour sauce or sweet chili sauce. Will also work well with spicy mayo.
