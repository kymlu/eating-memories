Preheat the oven to 350°F/175°C.

In a bowl, mix the **wet ingredients** together.

Add the **dry ingredients** in and mix until just combined.
> Overmixing will result in chewy dough.

Toss the <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">apples</span> and <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">flour</span> together to coat all the apple.
> This prevents the apples from sinking.

Add the apples to the batter and briefly mix.
> You can add other dry ingredients like walnuts, raisins, or cranberries for varied texture and flavour!

Line a muffin pan with muffin liners and scroop the batter into the pan.

For added crunch, sprinkle some <span class="ingredient">turbinado sugar</span> on top.

Bake for 20-24 minutes.
