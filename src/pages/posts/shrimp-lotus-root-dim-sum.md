Peel and devein the <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">shrimp</span>. Chop until it becomes a paste.
> Can also use a food processor.

Dice the <span class="ingredient" data-id="10">lotus root</span> into small cubes. Chop the <span class="ingredient" data-id="11">green onion</span> finely.

Combine the all the **filling** and **seasoning** ingredients (<span class="ingredient" data-id="3">white pepper</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="4">salt</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="5">soy sauce</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="6">cooking wine</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="7">sugar</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="12">sesame oil</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="8">neutral oil</span>, <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">cornstarch</span>) into a bowl. Mix in one direction until a sticky paste forms.
> Can chill the mixture for 20 minutes to firm up the paste.

Cut the <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">spring roll wrappers</span> into fine strips. Lay out the strips flat out on a sheet or a plate.
> One recipe called for 0.25 inch, but in the show, they cut it very finely. The thinner you go the nicer the texture.

Wet hands with water and then roll a tablespoon of shrimp into a ball. Roll the ball onto the strips until fully coated.

In a pan/wok, heat oil to 350°F/175°C and then fry in samll batches until golden brown. After frying, place the balls onto a paper towel to dry.

Serve plain or with chili oil.
