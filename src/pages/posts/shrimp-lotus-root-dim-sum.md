Peel and devein the <span class="ingredient" data-id="1">shrimp</span>. Mince until it becomes a paste.
> Can also use a food processor.

Peel and mince the <span class="ingredient" data-id="10">lotus root</span>. Mince the <span class="ingredient" data-id="11">green onion</span>.

Combine the all the **filling** and **seasoning** ingredients into a bowl. Mix in one direction until a sticky paste forms.
> Can chill the mixture for 20 minutes to firm up the paste and make it easier to work with.

For each of the <span class="ingredient" data-id="2">spring roll wrappers</span>, roll into a cylinder and slice into fine strips. Unravel and lay the strips flat out on a sheet or a plate.
> Somewhere between 1/4 and 1/2 cm, but can slice even finer for a crispier texture that's easier on the mouth.

Wet your hands with water and then roll a tablespoon of shrimp into a ball. Roll the ball onto the strips until fully coated.
> It's ok if you can see some shrimp.

In a pan/wok, heat oil to 350°F/175°C and then fry in small batches until golden brown, around 4-5 minutes each. After frying, place the balls onto a paper towel to dry.
> To deep fry, heat oil on high until it hits the desired temperature. Put the balls in and take out when it's ready. Wait until the heat hits the desired temperature again before adding a new batch.

Is good plain, but can also taste good with a creamy chili sauce or sriracha mayo.
