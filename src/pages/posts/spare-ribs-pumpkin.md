Separate the **spare ribs** into individual ribs.

In a bowl, mix the **seasonings** together. Add the ribs and mix to coat and marinate for 10-30 minutes.

Cut up the **kabocha** into large chunks.
> Instead of pumpkin, you can use other starchy and earthy vegetables like taro, potato, and carrots. Uncooked sticky rice is also very good.

Place the marinated ribs and the kabocha in a plate for steaming (not one with holes).

Steam for 1-1.5 hours. Longer steaming = softer meat and veggies.
