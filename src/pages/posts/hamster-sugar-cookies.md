> These cookies are good in a not-animal form too.
# Making the dough
In a saucepan, toast the **milk powder** on low-medium heat until slightly browned, constantly stirring.

In a bowl, cream together the **butter** and the **sugar**.

Add the **water** and gently mix briefly.

Sift in the **toasted milk powder** and the **flour** and mix until combined.

Remove the **tea leaves** from the bag. With a mortar and pestle, in a bowl with a utensil that has a bulbous bottom (maybe a knife), or in a blender (if making a large batch), grind up the leaves finely.

Take about 45g from the dough and add the **ground tea leaves** and **molasses** (if you want). Mix/knead until combined.
> I think other flavour profiles would work too! Like apple spice (cinnamon, nutmeg, cardamom, allspice), for example.

# Shaping the dough
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

> The original recipe made hamsters, but I've also made bear heads and penguins. Try making any animal you want and change up their poses!
## Body
Take 4g of plain dough and roll into a ball. Place aside.

Take 1g of flavoured dough, roll into a ball, and then flatten into a circle in your palm. 

Place the plain dough ball onto the flat flavoured dough, and roll gently with your palms to combine the two into a smooth ball with two colours. On the surface, the flavoured dough should cover about half of the white dough.

Shape the ball into a pill shape and place on the cookie sheet. For a right-side-up hamster, the part with the flavoured dough should be on top.

## Ears
Take 2 tiny bits of flavoured dough and shape them into balls.

Place them on one end of the body where the ears would be. 

Gently press with a toothpick to give them the shape of ears and to make sure the ears stick to the body.

## Feet
Take 4 tiny bits of plain dough and shape them into balls.

Place them underneath the body where feet should be. It might be better to put them closer to the edge of the body rather than the middle as the shape of the cookie will melt down a little.

# Baking the cookie
Preheat the oven to 320F/160C.

Place the cookies in the fridge to keep cool and maximize shape retention when baking. 

Bake for 20 minutes. The colour should darken slightly. After taking the cookies out of the oven, wait for it to cool completely.

# Adding life to the cookie
Melt a few **chocolate chips** in a microwave. Add **a few drops of water** to thin it out.
> Alternatively, use dark cocoa powder instead of chocolate chips. If it's not dark, the colour will not show up as well.

With a toothpick, take a bit of the chocolate mixture and draw eyes on the end with the ears, and a line down the back.
